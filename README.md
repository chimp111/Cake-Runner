# Cake-Runner
Front run bot and liquidity sniper for Pancakeswap 

Cake Runner is a frontrunning bot primarily aimed at liquidity sniping on AMMs like PancakeSwap or uni. Liquidity sniping is the most profitable way I found to use it. But you can add pretty much any features involving frontrunning (liquidation, sandwich attacks etc..). Also includes a separate bot to buy new Coinmarketcap and Coingecko listings immediately after they’re listed.

Requirements for the bot to work:

-BNB to deploy the contracts and pay for gas 

-BSC HTTP or WSS node https://moralis.io/speedy-nodes/ 

-Server to run the bot on if you dont want your comuter on all day (I use aws)

-Telegram API for new CMC/CG token sniper https://my.telegram.org/auth

Features: 

-Liquidity sniper

-Frontrunner, sandwich attacker (not completely finished)

-Honeypot checker

-CMC/CG new listing sniper (need to create telegram api)
